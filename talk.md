## Abstract (100 words)

At 15, I accidentally crashed an ISP's servers while playing with security tools—and instead of getting arrested, I got my first job. That lucky break set me on a 30-year journey from a curious Dutch teenager to a software engineer at Spotify, via a PhD in South Africa and contributions to projects like the Square Kilometre Array. This talk is an honest look at what it actually takes: no genius required, no expensive bootcamps, just curiosity, persistence, and the willingness to seize opportunities when they appear. Practical advice for anyone starting their programming journey—wherever you are.

## Description (detailed)

### The Journey

I grew up in an average-income family in the Netherlands. At 14, I was volunteering at a local TV station when I discovered something interesting: the Windows NT systems at their internet provider didn't survive a "ping of death." I was just a curious kid playing with security tools—scripts I barely understood. By complete coincidence, the ISP heard there was a young person at the TV station who knew something about computer security. Instead of calling the police, they called me for help.

At 15, I had my first job as a security consultant.

**A word of warning**: I got lucky. In the early 2000s, law enforcement wasn't equipped to handle these situations. Today, the same curiosity could land you in jail. Don't do what I did.

Around the same time, I enrolled in an MBO (secondary vocational education) to study electronics. People had recommended it—I had no idea what I wanted to be. It was interesting enough that I earned my Cisco CCNA certification during the program. But I also realized: I don't want to repair fridges. I don't want to work with high-voltage equipment. I wanted to use my brain differently. I wanted software. I wanted science.

Here's the thing: I was a terrible student. My marks were bad. But once I found computing—something I actually cared about—everything changed. Between 15 and 18, I went from one of the worst performers to someone who genuinely wanted to excel.

**The lesson**: Not knowing what you want is normal. Being a bad student doesn't define you. Finding the right path changes everything.

That moment of curiosity—channeled in the right direction by sheer luck—set the trajectory for what followed:

- MBO in electronics (discovered it wasn't for me, but got my CCNA)
- Bachelor's in Software Engineering (Hogeschool van Amsterdam)
- Master's in Artificial Intelligence (University of Amsterdam)
- PhD in Radio Astronomy & Computer Science (Rhodes University, South Africa)
- 10+ years of freelance consulting for organizations like ASTRON, SARAO, SETI, and SURFnet
- Roles at DPG Media and now Spotify

### Key Themes

**1. Follow Interesting, Not Money**
My journey wasn't planned. I never had a five-year career strategy. I just followed what looked cool at the moment—security, then software engineering, then AI, then radio astronomy. Each pivot happened because something interesting appeared.

During my consulting years, I made the mistake of chasing money. It made me unhappy. The best career decisions I made were about curiosity, not income.

Then I got lucky. When Spotify launched in the Netherlands in 2010, I thought: that's my dream job. Twelve years later, I got it. I'm now living my teenage dream—and it pays well too. But the money came from following interesting work, not the other way around.

**2. Luck vs. Preparation**
Yes, I got lucky—but luck favors the prepared. Growing up in the Netherlands gave me access to:
- Affordable education
- Early exposure to computers
- A social safety net that allowed me to take risks

But these advantages only mattered because I was ready to use them.

**3. Python: My 30-Year Companion**
I've been using Python since my first job at that ISP. I've been a contractor for almost 30 years now, and Python has been central to all of it—so central that I named my company Pythonic.

I got lucky that Python became so popular. I've used it for everything: building websites, scientific computing, art projects, machine learning, you name it. For my Master's thesis, I built "Sonic Gesture"—a computer vision system that translated hand movements into MIDI music. I prototyped it in Python, then rewrote it in C++ when I needed real-time video performance. That pattern—prototype in Python, optimize later—has served me ever since.

I've witnessed Python's evolution: the painful Python 2 to 3 transition (a nightmare in science), the wheel format, metadata management, and now the modern tooling renaissance with uv and ruff.

Python is still one of the best languages to learn. It's easy to pick up, dominant in machine learning and data science, used in finance, and when you need performance, you can seamlessly mix in Rust. It's versatile, extensible, and has an incredible community.

**4. The Power of Open Source**
Python and open source were my great equalizers. My first contributions were to Debian—packaging software, submitting bug reports. This was before GitHub even existed. Contributing to projects taught me more than any course, connected me with maintainers worldwide, and built a portfolio that opened doors.

You don't need to write a major feature. Start small: fix a bug, improve documentation, package something. The open source community remembers contributors.

**A note on mentors**: I got lucky with people. My first mentor was the father of my first girlfriend—a geeky chemist who introduced me to science fiction, Rubik's Cubes, and Gödel-Escher-Bach. My parents didn't know this world existed; he opened the door.

His brother worked at SARA (now SURFsara), the Dutch national supercomputer facility, and arranged my MBO graduation internship there. That introduced me to scientific computing. From there I met people at SURFnet who later became clients. Teachers at the Hogeschool helped me bridge the math gap between my Bachelor's and Master's. One of my Master's professors was the creator of MonetDB—a database system I later worked on as a contractor, and which inspired DuckDB, now widely used in data science.

Each person led to the next. You can't plan this. But you can put yourself in positions where it might happen: stay curious, say yes to opportunities, and be someone others want to help.

**5. Scientific Computing as a Gateway**
My path wasn't the typical startup route. Radio astronomy, machine learning for electricity grids, signal processing for SETI—scientific computing offers unique opportunities to work on meaningful problems while building real skills.

**Balancing a PhD with freelancing**: This wasn't planned. I started the PhD in South Africa, but circumstances changed and I realized I'd be happier—and earn more—as a freelancer. So I did both.

For about two years, I worked four days a week for clients and one or two days on my PhD. That's a six-day workweek. It was exhausting. I finished just before COVID hit, which was lucky—I'm not sure I could have kept that pace through a pandemic.

My advice: if you're considering part-time education while working, be realistic about the cost. It's possible, but it will consume your life for a while. Make sure the goal is worth it.

**6. The Imposter Syndrome Paradox**
When I was young, I thought I was the smartest kid in the room. The more I learned, the more I realized how little I knew. Working with brilliant minds at the SKA project, at research institutions, at Spotify—imposter syndrome didn't fade with experience. It got worse.

Here's what I've learned: this is normal. The Dunning-Kruger effect is real. Early confidence comes from ignorance; later humility comes from understanding how much there is to know. It never threatened to stop me, but it was always there. If you feel like a fraud sometimes, welcome to the club.

**7. Learning from Failure**
Not everything worked. As a contractor, I had projects fail—sometimes due to inexperience, sometimes due to clients with unclear requirements. Here's a hard lesson: a client who doesn't know what they want is dangerous. They'll blame you when the project fails, even if the requirements were never clear.

Over time, I got better at identifying this early. Protecting yourself means asking hard questions upfront, documenting expectations, and sometimes walking away. This skill—reading people and situations—matters as much as technical ability.

**8. The Realistic Path**
- You don't need to be a genius
- You don't need expensive bootcamps
- You do need: persistence, curiosity, and the willingness to fail publicly

### What You'll Learn

- How to identify and leverage the opportunities around you
- Why contributing to open source can accelerate your career
- Practical steps to build skills without expensive resources
- How to navigate the transition from student to professional
- Honest talk about setbacks and failures along the way

### The New Reality: AI-Assisted Programming

The era of manual programming is over. At Spotify, I no longer type code—I talk to Claude using voice recognition. This very talk was created entirely through conversation with an AI assistant.

These tools have changed everything. I can now:
- Solve problems I never thought I could tackle
- Work orders of magnitude faster
- Build things that would have taken weeks in days

**But here's the nuance**: You still need to understand programming. AI assistants amplify your skills—they don't replace the need to learn. Get your hands dirty first, then use these tools to accelerate.

**The call to action**: If you're not using AI coding assistants yet, start now. Tools like Claude, GitHub Copilot, and Google's offerings are available—some with free tiers for students. This is the new literacy. Don't get left behind.

### Why This Talk for Namibia

My PhD brought me to South Africa to work on the Square Kilometre Array—and it also brought me something unexpected: I met my wife, a Namibian. We've been coming here regularly ever since, spending every Christmas with family, and I've grown to love this country.

Now we're making it official. My wife has taken a role at Hyphen, working on green hydrogen, and we're moving here with our child. I'm not a distant visitor giving advice from afar—Namibia is becoming home.

**The practical case for remote work from Namibia:**
- You're in (almost) the same time zone as Europe—no midnight meetings
- Everyone speaks English—European companies are looking for English-speaking developers
- Internet is fast and getting faster—Starlink is coming
- Cost of living is lower than Amsterdam or London

How do you find clients or remote jobs? I'll be honest: I found mine through my network. University classmates, colleagues from previous jobs, people I met at conferences. I don't have a magic formula. But I can tell you this: the network builds itself if you stay curious, contribute to open source, and keep showing up.

This isn't a talk about Silicon Valley dreams—it's about building a sustainable tech career wherever you are, including right here in Namibia.
